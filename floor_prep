This weekend is prep-work for [[Twenty Twenty Floor]].  Many things need to happen.  

### Mission Objective:
Get everything off the walls, off the floors and in boxes, so that over the course of this week we can move it into the pod storage being delivered Tuesday, May 28th, 2024.  This includes everything **except** furniture.  Some preparations may be made to make the breakdown of furniture easier, however we don't have anywhere to store couches and chairs until the POD gets here.  


> [!question] Do we have to get everything out of cabinets?  Like books?
> Yes, this will make it easier to move the furniture when the pod gets here.

> [!question] What do I do with my clothes in the closet?  Why do I have to take items off my walls?
> The contractors will kick out **a lot** of dust.  That's why we're taking everything off the walls and putting it back.  
> 
> I recommend that each family member packs a bag with 9 days worth of clothes that ya'll wanna wear.  We'll store the rest.  Living out of the bag will make it easier to do things like wash clothes at other folks houses (if required).  So please pick out those nine outfits and lets store the rest in boxes today for the pod.

> [!question] What about desk drawers?  Do I have to clean them out? 
> You can clear them out, go through them and figure out what you wanna keep.  Or remove them & just stack them for the pod.  Dealers choice.

> [!question] What will the cats do for litter boxes?
> Litter boxes stay!  Though they may move depending on the needs of the contractors.  

> [!question] What about items like dishes in the kitchen cabinets?  
> They don't need to be packed.  Those cabinets are fixed structures and the contractors won't need to get underneath them.  Though we won't have a dishwasher for a period of time, so we'll prolly get paper plates.  

> [!question] What will we eat without a dishwasher and a fridge?  
> We'll move the deep freeze into the workshop so we can still access it & power it.  We'll use the crockpot/instapot heavily until we can get our kitchen back.

> [!question] Where will we sleep?
> Wherever we can, around the contractors work.  

> [!warning] Homelab Systems Will Be Offline
> Unless I can develop a workaround self-hosted home-lab systems will not work.  Cameras, home assistant, file sharing and more.  
> Ethernet will not work.  Wifi connection only.
